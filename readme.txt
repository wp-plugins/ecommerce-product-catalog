= Display Products with Shortcode =

You can also use shortcode to show your products whenever you want on the website. Just paste on any page: [show_products] and you will display all products in place of the shortcode. 

To show products from just one category, use: [show_products category="2"] where 2 is category ID (you can display several categories by inserting comma separated IDs). 

To display products by IDs, use: [show_products product="5"], where 5 is product ID.

= Current Donation Goal =

* Feature - [show_categories] shortcode to show category listing on any page
* Feature - Ability to add separate sidebars for eCommerce Product Catalog
* Feature - Ability to choose different price formats such as $2500, USD2500 etc.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.0 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of impleCode eCommerce Product Catalog, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “impleCode” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our product catalog plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking Install Now. After clicking that link you will be asked if you’re sure you want to install the plugin. Click yes and WordPress will automatically complete the installation.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our product catalog plugin and uploading it to your web-server via your favourite FTP application.

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation’s wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

= Upgrading =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the product catalog pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.
